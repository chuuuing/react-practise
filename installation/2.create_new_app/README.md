Create app using **React toolchains**. THere are several **toolchains** for different purposes. Depends on what you what to build!

# Popular **React toolchains**:

### 1. create-react-app

`npx create-react-app my-app` React app

### 2. next-js

`Next.js` is a lightweight framework of React(assume you use `Node.js` as server). Including:

- serverâ€‘rendered applications
- styling
- routing solutions

### 3. `Gatsby`

Best way to create **static websites** with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs **pre-rendered HTML and CSS** to guarantee the fastest load time.

# How to build a **toolchain** from scratch?

A JavaScript toolchain consists of:

1. **package manager**: such as Yarn or npm. To manage third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
2. **bundler**: such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
3. **compiler**: such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.

To manually choose from those 3 tool types and build your **own** toolchain. Check this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@JedaiSaboteur/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658)
